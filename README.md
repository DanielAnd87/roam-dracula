Dracula Theme for Roam Research

# Credits

- CSS stylesheet based on [Hypnos theme](https://github.com/jordanmoore/hypnos) by [@jordanmoore](https://twitter.com/jordanmoore)
- Color pallette from [Dracula Theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) by [Zeno Rocha](https://draculatheme.com/)

# Installation

- Open or create your `[[roam/css]]` page in your roam instance
- In a code block (tripple \` backticks)
  - paste this single line: `@import url('https://gamell.io/roam-dracula/style.css');` -- this way you will automatically get any update I make to the theme, OR
  - paste the entirety of `style.css` (with your optional customizations)
- Enjoy the theme

Alternatively, you can also

- Install Stylus Chrome Extension
- Create a new Style override for `roamresearch.com` and
  - paste this single line: `@import url('https://gamell.io/roam-dracula/style.css');` -- this way you will automatically get any update I make to the theme, OR
  - paste the entirety of `style.css` (with your optional customizations)

# Feartures

![desktop](img/desktop.jpg)

- Enjoy your favorite theme in Roam Research
- Dark yet colorful: easy on the eyes and clean
- Monospace font for that hacker in you (if anyone knows how to enable the font's -- `Fira Code` -- ligatures, please let me know, thanks!)
- Better utilization of the horizontal space in big screens thanks to a better responsive layout
- Easily customizable! (see below)

# Customization

You can easily customize the colors by changing lines `66-72` of the file

# Contribute

I did my best to style all the UI, but I am sure I missed some spots, so any fixes & contributions are very welcome :)
